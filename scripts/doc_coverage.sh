# Javadoc / Doxygen DOCUMENTATION-COVERAGE gate for cheatah-space's public API.
#
# Runs Doxygen in a strict mode — EXTRACT_ALL=NO so nothing is auto-extracted,
# WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED + WARN_NO_PARAMDOC so every type, function, member, parameter and return value
# must be documented — and FAILS (exit 1) if any public entity lacks documentation. This is the
# "100% Javadoc" hard gate the QA gate enforces before every push.
#
# Every cheatah-space module header is hand-authored C++ (nothing is transpiler-generated), so the
# WHOLE package — the space/space.hpp umbrella and every space/<mod>/<mod>.hpp submodule — is inside
# this strict gate. `detail` namespaces are implementation, excluded by the Doxyfile.
#
#   scripts/doc_coverage.sh          # check; exit 1 if anything is undocumented
#   scripts/doc_coverage.sh report   # same, but always print the full doxygen log
